### Getting spotify stats on rainmeter
Old was was to get webnowplaying, a plugin through Specitify (tool to customize Spotify), but now Spotify supports NativeApi which sends information to Windows directly. Rainmeter is able to tap into this stream.

Go to settings in Spotify and make sure `Show desktop overlay when using media keys` is enabled.

### Using prepared layout
Layout file (`layout.ini`) should be named `Rainmeter.ini` and stored in folder:
```
C:\Users\_user_\AppData\Roaming\Rainmeter\Layouts\RainmeterPrivate
```
This is only a backup. Once the backup is placed in layouts folder, simply go to layouts panel in Rainmeter and load this layout.
